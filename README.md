A [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_%28software%29) bot , that connects the [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) from Discord. So that a user can give commands from discord directly to the terminal.
It accepts many shells like [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell), [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) and [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) to name a few....
